# Mite-abundance-response-to-climate-change
The case study to do data analysis on Mesostigmata mites in the soil during a year, in different ecosystems. Here we explored how the abundance of Mesostigmata mites is affected by the simulated greenhouse effect. We had also created predictive models to assess which predictors are important in the estimation of the abundance of these mites.
